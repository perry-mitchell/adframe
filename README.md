# About

Create **well-prepared** iframes that are designed to handle dynamic advertising content held within. This library doesn't necessarily need to only be used in the advertising realm, and its array of features will most likely find it useful in a variety of situations.

Iframes created using this library can use a number of content insertion methods (blob URLs, `document.write`, `srcdoc` etc.), some combinations of iframe `sandbox` flags, content-loaded detection and a wealth of other tools.

To dive straight in to creating an iframe, check out the [API documentation](API.md).

## Browser Support

IE 10 and newer.

_NB: This section not negotiable._
